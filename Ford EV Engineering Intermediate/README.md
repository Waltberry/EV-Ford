### README: Understanding EV Engineering

#### Simulation Overview
This simulation provided an immersive experience into electric vehicle (EV) engineering at Ford, encompassing two key tasks: evaluating battery form factors and LiDAR sensors, and exploring career paths in EV engineering.

#### Task 1: Assessing Design Tradeoffs

**Objective:** Evaluate the design tradeoffs of battery form factors and LiDAR sensors for mobile robots.

**What I Learned:**
- **Battery Form Factors:** Explored cylindrical, pouch, and prismatic batteries, considering cost, safety, durability, longevity, efficiency, and compactness.
- **LiDAR Sensors:** Compared mechanical scanning, solid-state, and hybrid LiDAR sensors based on initial cost, durability, resolution, scanning speed, and power consumption.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Conducted detailed analyses using tables to present findings clearly, aiding decision-making for engineering applications.

**Design Tradeoffs**
    Understanding design tradeoffs is crucial in engineering. Altering a single factor can affect multiple critical outcomes. When making a design decision, teams must prioritize factors and consider compromises between competing parameters.

    For example, increasing battery capacity might enhance performance but escalate costs and compromise safety or durability. Conversely, reducing battery capacity could save costs but reduce performance and longevity.

- **Applications**: Suitable for devices where space is not a critical factor.
- **Price Range**: $0.50 to hundreds of dollars per unit, depending on capacity.

###### Pouch Batteries
- **Cost**: Lower production costs due to simplified manufacturing.
- **Safety**: Soft packaging makes them more susceptible to damage.
- **Durability**: Average longevity of four years.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Lower resistance to heat dissipation.
- **Applications**: Ideal for space-efficient and flexible designs.
- **Price Range**: A few dollars to several hundred dollars per unit, depending on capacity.

###### Prismatic Batteries
- **Cost**: Reduced manufacturing complexity and costs due to standardized dimensions.
- **Safety**: Rigid casing provides moderate protection against damage.
- **Durability**: Average longevity of six years.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Higher energy densities in a smaller footprint.
- **Applications**: Suitable for compact designs requiring efficient space use.
- **Price Range**: $50 to several thousand dollars per unit, depending on capacity.

##### Comparing LiDAR Sensor Models

###### Mechanical Scanning LiDAR
- **Performance**: High angular resolution and long-range sensing.
- **Durability**: Moderate due to moving parts.
- **Cost**: $1,000 to $10,000 per unit, with high-performance models exceeding this range.
- **Applications**: Suitable for detailed environmental mapping over large distances.

###### Solid-State LiDAR
- **Performance**: High-speed scanning capabilities, energy-efficient.
- **Durability**: Enhanced due to the absence of moving parts.
- **Cost**: $10,000 to $100,000+ per unit, depending on model and resolution.
- **Applications**: Suitable for dynamic environments and fast-moving applications.

###### Hybrid LiDAR
- **Performance**: Balance between long-range sensing, high resolution, and fast data acquisition.
- **Durability**: Combines benefits of both mechanical and solid-state technologies.
- **Cost**: $5,000 to $50,000 per unit.
- **Applications**: Comprehensive 3D perception of the environment.

**Key Insights:**
- **Battery Selection:** Cylindrical batteries offer cost-effectiveness and reliability, pouch batteries suit compact devices, and prismatic batteries balance longevity and performance.
- **LiDAR Choices:** Mechanical LiDAR is cost-effective for detailed mapping, solid-state excels in durability and speed, while hybrid LiDAR balances performance and cost.

#### Task 2: Career Paths in EV Engineering
