# EV-Ford Engineering Project

## Overview

This project is part of Ford's electrical vehicle (EV) engineering division internship. The objective is to develop and implement various control systems and data analysis tools for EV engineering.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

EV-FORD/
├── Ford EV Engineering Intro/
│   ├── __pycache__/
│   ├── pid.py
│   ├── positionBasedController.py
│   ├── task1-data.xlsx
│   ├── task1-result.xlsx
│   └── velocityBasedController.py

### Files and Directories

- `__pycache__/`: Contains compiled Python files.
- `pid.py`: Implementation of the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.
- `positionBasedController.py`: Script for position-based control using the PID controller.
- `task1-data.xlsx`: Data file for task 1.
- `task1-result.xlsx`: Result file for task 1.
- `velocityBasedController.py`: Script for velocity-based control using the PID controller.

## Usage

### Position Based Controller

To run the position-based controller script, use the following command:
```sh
python positionBasedController.py
```

### Velocity Based Controller

To run the velocity-based controller script, use the following command:
```sh
python velocityBasedController.py
```

## Future Work

This project is ongoing and will be expanded to include more features and functionalities such as:

- Enhanced PID tuning mechanisms.
- Additional control strategies.
- Integration with real-time data sources.
