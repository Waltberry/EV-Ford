### Report: Learning Experience during the Job Simulation in Ford's Electrical Vehicle (EV) Engineering Division

#### Task 1: Visualizing Battery Capacity

**Overview**

My first task involved understanding different battery chemistries and their impact on battery capacity. I analyzed and visualized battery capacity data for three distinct battery chemistries: Lithium-Ion (Li-ion), Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4), and Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH).

**What I Learned**

1. **Battery Chemistries**:
   - **Lithium-Ion (Li-ion)**: Known for high energy density and long cycle life, making them ideal for EVs despite higher costs and safety concerns.
   - **Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4)**: Offers excellent safety and thermal stability with a longer lifespan but lower energy density.
   - **Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH)**: Durable and cost-effective with lower energy density, previously popular in hybrids.
   - Solid-State: Higher energy density, faster charging, superior safety, high cost, and technical challenges.
   - Lithium Polymer (LiPo): Flexible design, lightweight, similar cost and safety challenges to Li-ion.

2. **Impact on Battery Capacity**:
   - **Energy Density**: Determines how much energy a battery can store relative to its weight or volume. Higher energy density translates to greater capacity and extended vehicle range.
   - **Voltage**: Influences the total energy capacity. Higher voltage generally means more energy storage.
   - **Specific Chemistry**: Different materials and chemical compositions result in varying capacities, with trade-offs in safety, lifespan, and performance.

3. **Detailed Breakdown of Common EV Battery Chemistries**:
    - Lithium-Ion (Li-ion):
        Energy Density: High
        Voltage: High
        Specific Chemistry: Various types, generally optimized for high capacity and performance.
        Impact: Offers significant energy storage in a lightweight package, extending the EV's range. Requires careful management for safety.
    - Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4):
        Energy Density: Lower than standard Li-ion
        Voltage: Lower
        Specific Chemistry: Optimized for safety and longevity.
        Impact: Lower energy capacity but enhanced safety and longer lifespan, making it suitable for applications where safety is prioritized over range.
    - Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH):
        Energy Density: Lower than Li-ion
        Voltage: Moderate
        Specific Chemistry: Durable and cost-effective.
        Impact: Heavier battery packs leading to lower overall vehicle efficiency but cost-effective for certain applications.
    - Solid-State:
        Energy Density: High
        Voltage: High
        Specific Chemistry: Promises faster charging and superior safety.
        Impact: Higher energy density and faster charging times. Current limitations include high costs and technical challenges in mass production.
    - Lithium Polymer (LiPo):
        Energy Density: Similar to Li-ion
        Voltage: High
        Specific Chemistry: Flexible design and lightweight.
        Impact: Offers design flexibility and lightweight advantages. Shares similar cost and safety challenges to Li-ion.

4. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Using Excel, I created charts to visualize battery capacity over time for the three chemistries. This helped me understand how each chemistry performs under similar conditions and the practical implications for EV range and efficiency.

#### Task 2: Tuning a PID Controller

**Overview**

In the second task, I transitioned to the robotics research division. The focus was on understanding and tuning PID(Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers, which are critical for precise control in EV systems.

**What I Learned**

1. **Principles of PID Control**:
   - **Proportional (P)**: Determines the immediate response to the current error. Adjusting the proportional gain affects sensitivity and response speed.
   - **Integral (I)**: Addresses accumulated past errors, helping to eliminate steady-state errors. Higher integral gain speeds up correction but can cause instability.
   - **Derivative (D)**: Anticipates future errors by considering the rate of change. Higher derivative gain improves reaction time but can introduce noise and instability.

2. **Applications in EVs**:
   - **Speed Control**: Maintaining consistent vehicle speed by adjusting motor power.
   - **Torque Management**: Distributing torque to optimize traction and handling.
   - **Regenerative Braking**: Maximizing energy recovery during braking.
   - **Steering Assistance**: Enhancing responsiveness and ease of steering.
   - **Battery Management**: Regulating charging and discharging for battery health.
   - **Thermal Management**: Controlling cooling and heating systems for optimal performance.

3. **PID Tuning**:
   - The process involves trial and error, adjusting P, I, and D values to achieve the desired system performance. Each component must be finely tuned to balance responsiveness, stability, and accuracy.

**Summary of the Code Examples**

- **Velocity-Based Control (Static PID Values)**:
  - The control values remain constant, providing a fixed response to errors. This approach is simpler but less adaptable to changing conditions.

- **Position-Based Control (Iterative PID Updates)**:
  - Continuously updates control values based on real-time feedback, improving accuracy, stability, and adaptability. This dynamic approach is more complex but essential for precise control in varying environments.
